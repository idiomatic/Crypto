# NaCl-like Cryptography Library for World of Warcraft Lua

[NaCl](https://nacl.cr.yp.to) is a easy-to-use high-speed software
library for encryption, signatures, *et al*.

[World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/) is a massively
multiplayer online role-playing game.

[Lua](https://www.lua.org/) is a lightweight programming language well
suited for embedding into applications.

World of Warcraft wisely (up until now) empowered the players access
to an game client API through add-ons written in Lua.  Missing from
this client is cryptographic primitives and big (or even small)
integer math... until now.

**DISCLAIMER** This is not endorsed by the NaCl core developers.

**DISCLAIMER** This is not fully implemented.  Priority is given to
implementing hashing and signing.

**DISCLAIMER** This is not fully hardened against
[timing attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack).

**DISCLAIMER** This is not fully optimized, nor is there much
expectation of much improvement to be had while using only floating
point numbers, interpreted math primitives, and algebraic bit
operations.

**DISCLAIMER** This is not multitasking yet.  Ideally the client
should not freeze perceptibly while doing typical operations.

# Why

World of Warcraft is a complex "game".  It is full of cooperative and
competitive player-to-player interaction, resource and time
management, personal development and augmentation,
[metagaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming), and
dissemination of information of various levels of credibility and
convenience.  This library aims to directly and indirectly touch on
all those aspects.

## Objective

Trusted
[real-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing#Near_real-time)
distribution of information (including
[code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored-program_computer)) within
the client extends the capabilities of World of Warcraft.

## Use Cases

### Player Identification

Certain players (*e.g.*, add-on developers) may wish to be identified,
perhaps as immediately as upon character rolling.  However, neither
character names nor player identity are global.  There is a chance a
[hard coded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_coding) character name
is already taken on a realm, or a character may be forced to rename.

Alternatively, a published public key can be applied to an
add-on-channel broadcasted announcement message originating from the
public player.  That message can be repeated upon request by an
uninformed player with respondents choosing
[unicast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast), broadcast, or ignore
appropriately to avoid [amplification
attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Amplification).

To avoid spreading misinformation after a character rename or
deletion, the stashed identification message should eventually expire,
and be superseded by the most recent valid message.  It is up to the
public player to defend their character name until the expiration.

### Data Croudsourcing

Once a character has been identified, an add-on developer can collect
buffered messages from add-on users.  It is recommended that automatic
data be capped or
[FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))
to avoid add-on data bloat when the collector is away, unknown, or
lost.

### Tipping

A player providing a useful service may receive in-game currency tips
by identifying themselves and embedding a mailbox hook.  It is
recommended that a non-invasive player-centric-designed UI be present,
otherwise the add-on risks becoming spurned &mdash; and other add-ons
with tipping that respects the player are tainted.  Specifically:

* a modest button in the add-on's main frame's lower-right corner,
  about box, or settings panel.
* pressing the button presents an easily dismissible panel to specify
  a pledge.
* the panel may inoffensively disregard comically minuscule amounts
  (*e.g.*, less than 1 silver).
* the pledge panel may reveal whether the recipient is known on this
  realm, and how recently since the last identity announcement; this
  would be a reasonable time to request it if not already known nor
  overheard.
* upon character arrival to a mailbox with an outstanding pledge
  exceeding their gold-on-hand, the add-on sends mail with tip
  attached to the recipient (minus postage).
* the mailbox panel should not have its behavior overtly changed; it
  should discretely send the tip rather than linger in the message
  composition panel.
* the mail with the attached tip may trigger the mailbox panel to
  confirm sending an amount; this behavior should be left as-is.
* the player may be notified in the default chat frame that the tip
  was sent, as to explain why the "coin drop" sound just played.
* once the tip is believed sent, the add-on should reset the pledge to
  zero, with a preference to resetting versus sending duplicates.

### Man-in-the-Middle Communication

A character may wish to send information to another character through
an intermediary.  The intermediary might be untrusted, and/or the
destination character might be on a different realm visited by the
intermediary.

### Distributed Database

A group of players may wish to create and share information aided by
player identification and data verification.

* [DKP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_kill_points) or other guild resource management
* In-game [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) or [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) or other article publishing system
* [Conflict-free replicated data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) for a [collaborative editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_editing)
* [Merkle trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) for data synchronization
* [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) for distributed ledger

### Code Distribution

Lua code may be packaged and signed in a way to facilitate nearly
instantaneous updates.

# API

## Hashing

### crypto_hash(a)

`crypto_hash()` is a hash function that takes a "message" (an array of
any length of 8-bit bytes) and computes a fixed-sized "hash" value
(512-bit value split into an array of sixteen 16-bit numbers).  This
computed value is unique enough for strong cryptography.  Except for
the most trivial (*i.e.*, predictable) of messages, it is hard to
determine the original message merely from the hash.

``` lua
m = string_to_bytes("hello, world!")
h = crypto_hash(m)
```

Implemented as [SHA-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2).

## Signatures

### crypto_sign_keypair()

`crypto_sign_keypair()` generates a random "secret" private key and
corresponding "sharable" public key.  The private key is a 512-bit
value split into an array of sixty-four 8-bit bytes), with a 256-bit
secret random number and a copy of the 256-bit public key.
Distribution of public keys is beyond the scope of this library.

``` lua
pk, sk = crypto_sign_keypair()
```

### crypto_sign(m, sk)

`crypto_sign()` converts a message to a slightly-larger signed
message.  The original message is
[plaintext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext) and starts after
the signature.  The signature is sixty-four bytes long but could
change; extract the message using
[`crypto_sign_open()`](#crypto_sign_open).

``` lua
m = string_to_bytes("proclamation")
sm = crypto_sign(m, sk)
```

### crypto_sign_open(sm, pk)

`crypto_sign_open()` converts a signed message back to a message.  May
return a false value if the signature is invalid or the message has
been tampered.  Signed messages can be verified without revealing the
signer's private key.

``` lua
a2 = crypto_sign_open(sm, pk)
if a2 then
	m2 = bytes_to_string(a2)
end
```

Implemented as an [ECDH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman) over [Curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519) with [SHA-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2).

## Encoding

### string_to_bytes(s)

`string_to_bytes()` splits a string into an array of bytes.

``` lua
a = string_to_bytes(s)
```

### bytes_to_string(a)

`bytes_to_string()` merges an array of bytes into a string.

``` lua
s = bytes_to_string(a)
```

### bytes_to_hex(a)

`bytes_to_hex()` merges an array of bytes into a hexadecimal string.

``` lua
s = bytes_to_hex(a)
```

# Implementation Details

## Bitwise Operations

There is no bitwise operations (e.g., `<<`).  However, there is a
`bit` library of limited utility:

* inputs are apparently truncated to fit within 0 to 2<sup>32</sup>-1.
* the operations are functions, which incurs approximate overhead of 120ns.

An alternative is to use algebraic operations to simulate bitwise operations:

| C                             | bit                | algebraic               |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| `a << b` (overflowing)        | n/a                | `a * 2**b`              |
| `a << b` (truncating)         | `bit.lshift(a, b)` | `a % 2**(32-b) * 2**b`  |
| `a >> b` (logical)            | `bit.rshift(a, b)` | `(a - a % 2**b) / 2**b` |
| `a \| b` (when `a & b == 0`)  | `bit.bor(a, b)`    | `a + b`                 |

The floating-point division and modulo operations are apparently
faster than function calls to simple logical operations.

## Floating Point Numerics

There is no `integer` type, just `number`.  As a result, numbers are
integer-precise to about 2<sup>52</sup>.

## Big Integers

There is no native representation of integers bigger than
2<sup>52</sup>.  The work-around is to represent a big integer value
as an array of numbers, where each array element represents a
[signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signedness) slice of that
number.  [Overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow) is
accommodated by using 16-bit slices, allowing a sum of a few squares
of Â±2<sup>16</sup> numbers before having to carry overflows.

## Table Recycling

Table allocation is a costly operation, taking approximately 380ns.
Many "hot" functions take a table to recycle for their return value.
The table recycling functions are safe using the same output table
as one of the inputs.

## Loop Unraveling

Unlooping the [long
multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_algorithm#Long_multiplication)
algorithm in multiply256_t() into a non-looping humongous block of
code resulted in >5x improvement.  Thanks for the example, Go core
developers!

## Random

There is
[speculation](https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2270845-math-random-can-t-generate-a-good-random-number-since-it-uses-C-rand()?p=46904173&viewfull=1#post46904173)
that the World of Warcraft Lua API uses a non-standard (*i.e.*,
potentially better for crypto) math.random().
